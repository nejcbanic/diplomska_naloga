                SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software. Tunnel Vision Laboratories
reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights
despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted
in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical
limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.
You may not
            

            
                work around any technical limitations in the software;
                reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to
the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
                make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or
allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
                publish the software for others to copy;
                rent, lease or lend the software; or
                transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
            
        
        BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it

internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal,
reference purposes.
        EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws
and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include
restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.
        SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide
support services for it.
        ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.
        APPLICABLE LAW.
            
                United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Texas
 state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to
 claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The
 laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims
 under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
                Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other
 country, the laws of that country apply.
            
        
        LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may
have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights
with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This
agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the
laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE
RISK OF USING IT. TUNNEL VISION LABORATORIES GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES,
GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR
LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
YOUR LOCAL LAWS, TUNNEL VISION LABORATORIES EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
TUNNEL VISION LABORATORIES AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
            This limitation applies to
            
                anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
                claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
It also applies even if Tunnel Vision Laboratories knew or should have known
about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
